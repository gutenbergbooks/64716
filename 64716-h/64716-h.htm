iii. 1.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;To every thing
there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> time draws on to a close with
us, the last opportunities should be carefully regarded and
applied to some such purpose as may show what has been the chief
aim and the main design of past endeavours.</p>
<p>A sad thing it would be, indeed, if the last portion of our
time were to be reserved for some single effort: for who can
accomplish at one step that which a daily progress only can
effect?</p>
<p>They who enjoyed long lives of old time, indulged, it must be
owned, in some complaints which showed more of the weakness of
our common nature, than of that proficiency for which the loan of
life, whatever <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>may be the term of its duration, is bestowed.&nbsp; The
good king Hezekiah poured his lamentation, when it should seem he
had much cause to be contented with what God had wrought for him
in his day.&nbsp; He called that &ldquo;the cutting off his
days,&rdquo; which it may be thought he might have met with more
complacency of mind, from the contemplation of the benefits which
God had enabled him to procure for Israel: but if there was any
token of infirmity in this, it was coupled with a pious mind, and
the suit was therefore heard and granted.&nbsp; If David, too,
seems sometimes querulous in his pleas for the enlargement of his
days, yet he added a good and becoming reason for it, that he
might show the power of God to that generation in which his
eventful lot was cast, and make it known to those who were to
come.</p>
<p>But we may remark in general, that we do not form a right
judgment of the Providence of God, if at any time we speak with
disparagement of the term of human life, as too short for the
accomplishment of things which form its proper end.&nbsp; We
should consider, rather, that in all cases the gift of life is
made capable of some sufficient share of the mercies and
salvation of the Lord.&nbsp; It becomes so for all who partake a
common nature, where they put no impediment to the current and
communication of Divine Grace.&nbsp; Let us weigh this point with
care: it has a seasonable application at this moment, since it
will prevent undue regrets when any portion of the loan of life
may cease to serve the purposes to which <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>it may have
been conducive whilst the season for its exercise endured.</p>
<p>If, then, it is the child who is called hence to an early
grave, he goes with the seal of grace upon him; and what was
wanting here, the bud, the blossom, and the ripened cluster, will
thrive in a happier soil, and flourish in a more propitious
climate.&nbsp; The thread of life, which, in this case, was so
soon severed from the parent&rsquo;s bosom, was fastened to the
throne of heaven, and death has no power to dissolve it.&nbsp;
The Conqueror of Satan, who brought life and immortality to
light, will not exclude those little ones, whom He once called
into his presence, from the rescued train of countless multitudes
who shall hear that glad word of introduction, &ldquo;Behold, I
and the children whom God hath given me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
privileges of the Gospel stood pledged to them in this life to
render their change blessed to themselves, and to leave that
consolation, in the day of sorrow, for surviving friends.</p>
<p>If the call hence comes in somewhat of maturer years, though
still in the days of youth, the young man will have lived long
enough to have learned the rudiments of saving knowledge, and to
have practised the first lessons of Christian faith and Christian
duty; and thus the best end for which the loan of life was given,
will have found that happy earnest of its future fulness.</p>
<p>If, again, the thread of life shall have been continued to
later periods of its course, no doubt the <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>opportunities
for all those advantages to which life can minister, will render
it at all times a blessing and a boon.&nbsp; Nor will you wonder,
in comparing the longer with the shorter term of life, that the
suit of supplicating parents in our Lord&rsquo;s days, whether
for the child or for the youth, was so often granted by a
restoration to a more protracted term of life.&nbsp; You will not
wonder that our Blessed Lord should so mark the value of the life
which now is, and its connexion, by a right improvement of it,
with the life of glory.&nbsp; We are bound, indeed, to bless God
for all the dispensations of his hand, for they all serve for
good; but we must not reverse the language, not of natural
feeling only, but of more just conceptions of the purposes for
which life is given, or be led to think that death is the boon,
and that a return to this life could be no blessing.&nbsp; When
did our Lord make that answer to the mourner&rsquo;s suit? or
when did He reprove the tears and sorrows of survivors with that
cold reply?&nbsp; So little ground is there, among the
singularities of dress and manners in which some have placed so
much of their religion, for refusing to put on the mourning weed
for the departed.&nbsp; There is but a single instance in the
Sacred Volume of a prohibition so enjoined; and then it was
designedly portentous, denoting the last extremity to which
offences had grown up in Israel, and the punishments which were
to follow.</p>
<p>If now the term of life runs on, and the seasons <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>are
prolonged, old age comes forward, and not without its burdens and
privations.&nbsp; Will you plead here with old Barzillai, to whom
David gave a gracious invitation, to mark the sense he
entertained of the value of past services, proposing that he
should return with him when he was restored from exile, and
brought back in peace and honour to Jerusalem?&nbsp; The old
man&rsquo;s answer was not entirely the most proper and becoming:
&ldquo;and Barzillai said unto the king, Can thy servant taste
what I eat, or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of
singing-men or singing-women?&nbsp; Wherefore, then, should thy
servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Barzillai, if this was ill spoken, showed a prudent spirit in
what followed, for he puts in a prompt plea for his son:
&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thy servant Chimham; let
him go with my lord the king, and do with him what shall seem
good unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now David might, no doubt, have
replied, &ldquo;I want you for the council-board, where your sage
experience may yield me better service than this youth can
furnish.&rdquo;&nbsp; But David had a due regard to the
privileges of descent, and to the preference to be shown to the
children of deserving parents who may spend their lives in the
service of their country, and frequently can find no reward in
this life, but in the persons of surviving children.&nbsp; It is
the plain stamp of barbarism which rests upon those governments
which do not recognize this principle, and where the hand of
power makes one only testament <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>for the frail possessor after all his
services.&nbsp; David formed a different judgment; he accepted
Barzillai&rsquo;s tender of his son; he followed the same course
which he had pursued with poor Mephibosheth, the son of the
princely, noble-minded Jonathan, who preferred the known will of
God, and his love to David, to the crown of one who had incurred
the forfeiture of what he had so ill-sustained.&nbsp; David
placed Mephibosheth at his own board, although he could neither
serve him in the field, nor attend him in his exile.&nbsp; The
first order made upon the king&rsquo;s return, after receiving
Mephibosheth&rsquo;s excuse, was to confirm to him the grant
which had before been made in his behalf.</p>
<p>Thus have we traced the several stages of the life of man, and
in each of them we have found that life might be a blessing, and
the ground of every blessing; and that God, ever gracious, ever
merciful, might crown with some word of benediction the closing
days of each such term or period of the life of man, just as He
did the six glorious days of the creation.&nbsp; The morning and
the evening (for so we reckon time) were followed by a solemn
benediction, but with a special blessing for the Sabbath-day, the
crown of all that stupendous work, the day sanctified by the
Creator&rsquo;s rest; the day claimed for Himself, with a marked
reserve, such as the true Proprietor of all that He had made, and
of all the bounties which distinguished man&rsquo;s first abode
in Paradise, was pleased to attach to one tree in the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>garden, by
which the first pair might be reminded of the homage due to God,
and might fulfil it by a strict regard to his commandment.</p>
<p>The Sabbath-day!&nbsp; With what joy must its regular returns
have been hailed in the first scenes of an unblemished world; and
how good and gracious was the Author of that first hallowed
institution, so that in the day of forfeiture, not only was the
first pledge of salvation given, but the welcome respite from
increasing labours by returning Sabbaths was continued.&nbsp; It
had no limitation or exception in its first appointment, nor
should we presume to put such; much less was there any intimation
given in that hour that the appointment of this day, with its
solemn benediction, was but an anticipated notice of the Jewish
Sabbath, together with what was indeed peculiar to it, when,
after long intermissions or neglects, it was revived.&nbsp; Can
we think that when &ldquo;for every thing there is a
season,&rdquo; there was to be none more especially provided, in
all times, for religious observation? and that, too, when the
Sovereign Lord had set his seal to such provision, without one
word which could affect its perpetuity?&nbsp; Accordingly we find
a set time for religious exercises mentioned in that new scene of
discipline and trial to which man was removed; for, indeed, he
was not cast out as an alien and an enemy, a wanderer and a
wretch.</p>
<p>In this hour of closure for my pastoral care among you, it may
not be unseasonable to advert to things <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>which have
found their turns in hours of teaching and persuasion.&nbsp; Let
me then entreat you to remember those first acts of grace, the
early grounds of good hope, which made life itself, with all its
seasons, a blessing, and, if rightly husbanded, the seed-plot of
all blessings to the sons of men.&nbsp; Nothing but a new
apostasy could destroy that hope, when the term of life was
continued where it might have been cut short, in which case the
human race would have been extinguished, and that triumph would
have been given to the common foe to God and man.&nbsp; Nothing
but a new apostasy from God would render man, in his state of
promised rescue and encouragement and in the new term of his
probation, an enemy to God.&nbsp; Before that horrible desertion
from his worship, the Most High made his visit to the patriarchal
altar, and gave that memorable declaration of his will, &ldquo;If
thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
ground was laid in purpose and effect for that acceptance; and
surely the assurance thus added was not for one family.</p>
<p>Thus there is a Sabbath still set apart for a welcome day of
rest, and for religious exercises; a day, the joy of which I have
so often shared with you in these happy seasons of religious
worship and communion.&nbsp; Remember the well-timed distinctions
which He who was Lord also of the Sabbath-day, as the partner of
his Father&rsquo;s glory, prescribed for the right observance of
the day, divesting it of its legal <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>strictness and peculiarities, and
still more protecting it, by an open vindication of its essential
objects, from Jewish scruples and from Jewish superstitions.</p>
<p>O look well to the duties of the Christian Sabbath!&nbsp; We
want no traditionary warrant for its transfer to the glad day of
the Redeemer&rsquo;s resurrection.&nbsp; The Scriptures furnish
plain and indubitable vestiges of that change.&nbsp; Look well to
its salutary obligations, bound upon us by the twofold cogency of
precept and example.</p>
<p>Remember who it was, who, after the scene of his ministerial
labours, kept his last Sabbath in the grave, and crowned with
perpetual glory the day of his triumphant resurrection.&nbsp;
Well might that day become not only the day of rest from labour,
but a day of gladness and release from worldly cares and
occupation, and, above all, the happy emblem of a rest from every
evil work, a respite from a bondage worse than that of servile
Egypt, a rest too from the galling yoke and ruling power of sin,
which is the privilege of faith.</p>
<p>Among such topics as may now claim a seasonable repetition, I
may again remind you how much it behoves us, in consulting the
written word, the rule of faith and duty, to avoid all partial
views, by which restriction one truth would exclude another; or,
what is worse, a wrong conclusion may be joined with what is only
true in some respects, and both the truth and the fallacious
inference may thus gain <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>currency together.&nbsp; The neglect
of this rule has brought more strifes and divisions into the
Christian world than almost any thing that can be named.&nbsp;
Take an instance if you think fit; there is more joy when that
which is lost is found again, than for that which was never
lost.&nbsp; This is true in that respect; but will you strain the
matter farther, and say that the recovered sheep is of more worth
than the whole flock to which it is restored?&nbsp; Will you say
that the piece of silver which was missing, and when found
creates much joy on that account, outweighs all that the purse,
from whence it dropped, contained?&nbsp; Will you say, that the
pardoned son, who returns to the right path by a true repentance,
and fills his father&rsquo;s heart with well placed and unwonted
joy, is in all respects to be preferred to the son who never left
the right path from an early day?&nbsp; The forgiving
father&rsquo;s answer will convict that
misconception:&mdash;&ldquo;Son, thou art ever with me, and all
that I have is thine.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the elder brother may be
thought to have lost his preference, it could only be because of
his envious temper and his ill-timed remonstrance.&nbsp; In
avoiding partial views and misapplications of what is true, the
more numerous and more general and plainer testimonies, and those
which admit but of one construction, will be the guiding light
for reconcilement and consistency&mdash;not for preference, for
that would still be but a partial view.</p>
<p>I may here add a necessary caution (oftentimes <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>suggested,
for it frequently proves needful), to give heed to the native
idioms or forms of speech, which were in use, and rightly
understood, by those to whom the word of treaty and persuasion
was first addressed.&nbsp; The use of learned pains will thus
appear, as well as of every method of right reasoning in the
study of the sacred Scriptures, the rule of faith and duty for
which we have to bless God daily.</p>
<p>I may now touch upon the best and only safe ground of trust
which we have to take in any season of review, when past portions
of our lives are recalled to our consideration.&nbsp; We may
look, now, to the hope of pardon, and allowance for things done
amiss, or things left undone; and blessed be God that ground has
been laid, or who could stand in judgment in the last
account?&nbsp; Certainly not the boastful and punctilious
Pharisee; certainly not those who have keener eyes for the faults
of others than for their own defects.&nbsp; Excellent are the
words of our Lord&rsquo;s apostle, and now most seasonable in
their application; thus he marks it for a ruling principle of
charity, that it &ldquo;thinketh no evil,&rdquo; and is not,
therefore, apt to censure or condemn.</p>
<p>It is but in some respects, that we can speak well of those
whom we are least inclined to censure, and most ready to regard
with favour;&mdash;and with that remark I shall fairly take leave
of what concerns myself in this day of valediction.</p>
<p>But I am well aware that the season of departure from
accustomed scenes of duty is a proper season <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>for advice,
and to this last tribute of sincere affection and regard, I will
now address myself.</p>
<p>We stand much for authority, for rights of station, and the
sacred warrant of the pastoral commission&mdash;and we do well,
for without them there would be no order in the world, no joint
progress in a common path; no peace, no security.&nbsp; When
every man in Israel did what was right in his own eyes, and
nothing by direction or consent, it was a day of trouble and
disaster, of ruin and confusion.&nbsp; They who will own no guide
in the way they have to tread, had need be well acquainted with
the road.</p>
<p>It would be well if such men, who despise all guides, would be
content to go alone&mdash;but was it ever so seen in all the
world?&nbsp; Are not such the men who strive most eagerly to
press others into their train from all quarters where they can
obtrude themselves and spread their pestilent opinions, and lay
their destructive snares?</p>
<p>But the rules of pastoral advice derive their obligation from
the simplest forms of truth; were it otherwise, how would they
meet the varied calls for choice and resolution which come
forward in the course of human life?&nbsp; If the truth itself
has no special period for the height and measure of its growth in
human breasts, yet it has for its perpetual standard God&rsquo;s
own eternal attributes.&nbsp; In those perfections of the Deity,
the sure test of truth is established.&nbsp; Our Lord&rsquo;s
apostle takes this ground; &ldquo;He that cometh to God, must
believe that he is;&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>and observe what follows, &ldquo;and
that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek
him;&rdquo;&mdash;in which two particulars, the existence of God,
and the never-failing characters of truth, wisdom, equity, and
goodness in such expressions of his favour, the sure foundations
of his moral government are laid, as well as the sum of every
moral and religious obligation.&nbsp; This appears in all the
articles of faith, and in all the acts of duteous service; it
appears in all that God hath done for us in the great work of our
redemption more especially, and in all that he requires of us in
order to a future recompense.</p>
<p>Let no vicissitude in things by which men are tried, but with
a sure refuge under all events for the dutiful, tempt you for a
moment to forget that the &ldquo;ways of God are equal:&rdquo; it
was his own challenge to backsliding Israel, and the last result
will not fail to confirm it.&nbsp; Let no light conceit at any
time induce you to suppose that the great truths, upon which the
hope of our salvation is built, may be regarded as things
indifferent, for which another season may be found; or that such
things, with all their convincing proofs and trains of evidence,
are placed beyond our reach.&nbsp; Can we think that our
Lord&rsquo;s word is not verified, that, &ldquo;Wisdom should be
justified of her children?&rdquo;&nbsp; And with respect more
particularly to disingenuous pleas of difficulty, do we find the
rules of faith and duty things so hard to be ascertained?&nbsp;
Have we no sufficient traces of them in the light of conscience;
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>in the
bright tokens and communications of God&rsquo;s own grace and
solemn declarations, in the powers of right discrimination,
without which there could be no reasonable choice of any thing
that best deserves our compliance?&nbsp; Have we not (blessed be
God!) the sacred, never-erring Word, which has been written for
our learning, and for our sure direction in all things needful to
salvation?</p>
<p>It is much to be observed, in such general statements, that
the Apostles of our Lord never failed to add to their reasonings
with Jew or Gentile, scribe or sophist, such comprehensive
testimonies of the grounds of faith and the fruits of holiness in
those who continue true to their engagement, as will leave no
room for uncertain tests or bold opinions, for endless
fluctuations in the mind and conduct, with doubts and
difficulties of our own creating.&nbsp; It is true, that in the
revelations of God&rsquo;s will there are things which no human
faculties, or even those of the purest of created beings in the
realms of light, could penetrate, until the Most High so
graciously revealed them,&mdash;things which relate to his own
Essence, with his purposes and counsels for the redemption of
mankind; but is it so hard to understand that when all was
forfeited, God should send a Saviour from the throne of glory to
become the new Head of mankind, by taking flesh, and in that
nature, which He by his Divine prerogative had power to assume,
to fulfil all that wherein our common sire had failed?&nbsp; Was
not this a nobler exercise of <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Divine wisdom, than the creating a
new race, and leaving that triumph to the common foe to God and
man, that one such race was lost?&nbsp; Is it so hard to be
understood, that to vindicate the credit of God&rsquo;s Holy Law,
there should be one sufficient satisfactory atonement, one
sacrifice never more to be repeated or renewed? or that, by the
prevailing intercession of the same Divine Redeemer, the gates of
Heaven should be set wide to a rescued race, whose own exertions
should from thenceforth be well employed, in spite of all the
force and all the artifices of the common adversary?&nbsp; The
glory of Divine grace is thus exalted, when the first gifts of
God are again directed to their proper ends.&nbsp; To raise
children unto Abraham of the stones of the desert, had been, no
doubt, an easy task to the Almighty; but would it have served so
highly to his glory, as the preservation and recovery of the
first formed race?&nbsp; Is it so hard to perceive how signally
the conspiring attributes of God, his justice, truth, and mercy,
were thus illustrated and made to meet together in that work of
redemption, which was accomplished in Christ Jesus?&nbsp; Does it
require much scope of argument or pains of study to enable us to
see, that to redeem mankind was an object no less worthy of
Divine interposition, than to create them from the first?</p>
<p>Again, could we safely remain strangers (as some would gladly
seem to do) to the several branches of all moral obligations,
when they have been confirmed <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>anew, and drawn out into manifest
example, and set before us so expressly for our imitation, in our
Lord&rsquo;s own life?</p>
<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s brief enumeration of faith, hope, and
charity, forms the sum of what in other places he sets forth with
a large detail of things required of us, all serving to the same
end and intent: only, remember carefully what that end
is,&mdash;it is not the same for which Christ wrought and
suffered, and He only could sustain; yet is it the
&ldquo;reasonable service,&rdquo; or &ldquo;living sacrifice of
the whole man,&rdquo; which is required, in order not only to our
own improvement, which could not thrive without it, but in order
to a promised recompense, which, together with the freedom of the
Gospel state, were procured for us at so rich a cost.&nbsp; The
ransom paid, the heritage obtained, by one only righteous
Mediator, how widely do they differ from the promised recompense
for the faithful and sincere! and yet how consistent are these
things in their whole effect!&nbsp; There is one judgment-seat
for both, and one form of judicial sentence, though in different
respects, is applied to both; but how different is the language
in which the same Apostle speaks of each.&nbsp; There is no need
to call in the suffrage of a fellow-witness to correct his view,
for both he and his fellow-witness, when they speak of the same
things, use the same language, and declare the same consistent
judgment.</p>
<p>And what, then, is our Lord&rsquo;s compendious draft <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>of things
required of us in the days of our probation? it is &ldquo;to love
the Lord our God with all the heart, and with all the soul, and
with all the mind, and with all the strength; and our neighbour
as ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Will you strain a flight beyond this,
and regard the care for yourselves as too low a pitch for your
wishes to excel, or for the native worth of what is good?&nbsp;
Do but consider that the welfare and the happiness of his
reasonable creatures formed the first object and design of the
Creator, and can never cease to be his purpose; consider, too,
that any kind of moral goodness which should not be good for us,
would want just so much of real goodness, and of its proper and
essential excellency.&nbsp; It was one of the vilest errors of
the heathen world, and one which prevailed much, as their
earliest historian tells us, that there was envy towards man
among the gods; and no wonder, if the rule of Providence could be
placed in such hands as they feigned for its administration.</p>
<p>Again, as the truth itself is always true, and virtue, which
is its image, is no less uniform and constant, most groundless
and injurious must be those restrictions which would shut out any
one real virtue or its exercise from the Christian pattern; for
in so doing we should detract just so much from its
integrity.&nbsp; You may reverse the proposition if you think
fit, and say, with truth, that every virtue puts on the Christian
character, not from any date of their adoption, but as they are
cherished and enhanced <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>by new motives and inducements, and
strengthened by the bond of unity and concord in the Christian
household.</p>
<p>Can I forget at this moment, befriended as I have been in the
past scene of my labours, that among the virtues which some would
leave to the heathen, together with the patriot spirit and the
courage to maintain it, Friendship has been made to share the
sentence of exclusion?&nbsp; At this rate the noble-minded
Jonathan could not be added to the list of worthies, to recount
which St. Paul found the day too short.&nbsp; But the glowing pen
of David has inscribed the name of his generous and ever-constant
friend with the sons of faith, in characters which no time shall
efface.&nbsp; And what then?&nbsp; Had our blessed Lord no family
of friends which brought him even weeping to the grave of
Lazarus?&nbsp; Was it for nothing that it was then said,
&ldquo;Behold how he loved him?&rdquo;&nbsp; Had our Lord no
disciple who was laid in his bosom at the paschal feast; to whom
also He gave his last charge concerning her who should be blessed
among women?&nbsp; Most gladly, therefore, shall I pay the debt
of friendly obligation on my removal from among you, and cherish
that good property of mind which has so many moral motives for
exciting its first growth, and brings forth so many moral fruits
in its maturity which may be stored in everlasting garners.</p>
<p>But as strange as that distinction is which would cast out
real virtues from the Christian code, I may <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>now warn you
from an opposite extreme.&nbsp; Thus have words of <i>counsel</i>
been exalted above the word of the <i>commandment</i>.&nbsp; Let
us weigh this also for a moment; it has been, and continues still
to be, the nurse of many fond conceits.</p>
<p>If you strive to put more into a vessel which is already well
replenished, will you not displace some of its contents?&nbsp;
And if this be done where the hand of the Lord hath filled the
vessel, that we may drink and thirst no more, but live for ever,
the loss (not to name the sacrilege) will outweigh the gain a
thousand-fold.&nbsp; The boastful young man, who would not accept
the word of the commandment at our Lord&rsquo;s lips as a full
reply to his inquiry, but said, &ldquo;All this have I kept from
my youth up; what lack I yet?&rdquo; did not receive, in answer
to this pretension, a word of counsel.&nbsp; Our Lord showed him
plainly what the true breadth of the commandment was.&nbsp; Thus
he required no more of him than that which became the bounden
duty of many in the days of trouble which succeeded.&nbsp; Many
were made to feel the force of that never-changing precept, which
demands the sacrifice of all things sublunary, where the bond of
Truth cannot otherwise be kept.&nbsp; There was no sacrifice,
then, proposed to this aspiring youth, nothing counselled, beyond
the verge of the commandment; and the test to which he was put
was but the fruit of his overweening zeal.</p>
<p>When some of the early Christians were not <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>contented to
wait the coming of the fore-named obligation, but sought
martyrdom of their own accord, although our Lord enjoined them
when persecuted in one city to flee into another, the Church
interposed, and set a mark of public censure upon such rash
exposures of the lives of faithful men.&nbsp; Will you say, then,
that St. Paul put forward words of counsel for which he
acknowledged that, in advising what was best for those days of
peril, he had no commandment?&nbsp; He did so; but as he had
received no commandment, so did he impose none.&nbsp; He left his
converts free to follow his advice according to their own
discretion: he laid no bond upon them, no vow, no snare, no
scruple; for, indeed, he was the steady foe to things
unbidden.</p>
<p>And what, then, are the general and never changing precepts
which no flight of zeal can surpass?&nbsp; We have already taken
one such comprehensive rule from our Lord&rsquo;s lips; but to
enlarge a little on a theme so seasonable at all times, we may
remark, that the word of precept requires us to weigh and esteem
things according to their real worth; to seek the kingdom of God
first, and his righteousness; to prize that pearl of price above
all other things; to take readily, as St. Paul showed in his
example, what God giveth, with a thankful and becoming use of the
welcome gift, but with a just sense that what may be bitter and
distasteful, if such be the cup, will serve for good to those who
love God; we are thus enjoined to be content with such things as
we <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>have,
to keep under and to combat every evil inclination, for there
lies the place and proper exercise of self-denial; it will prove
unfit and injurious when pressed beyond its uses.&nbsp; It was
the aim of the apostle to set free to all things lawful and
becoming, but not to be brought under the power of any; which
shows at once the misery and inconvenience of an iron chain,
whether forged by others, and imposed upon us in their names, or
adopted by our own devices.</p>
<p>He who will set up better rules than these, must not expect
his word to be taken for them; he must prove them by the known
declaration of the will of God, or by sufficient reasons, tried
by the sure word of the <i>commandment</i>.</p>
<p>There were not wanting, we may now remark, many who passed the
season of attendance before the coming of the promised Mediator,
with some profit to themselves and others.&nbsp; We have noticed
this with respect to the patriarchal age and to the Israel of
God; and it holds good, in some measure, with relation to the
Gentile world.&nbsp; There were those even where the hideous
darkness of idolatry prevailed, among whom truth found its
seasonable culture.&nbsp; There were those who sustained in some
sort the credit of the human race.&nbsp; They sought a refuge in
their own reflections from false worship, and delusions gross,
impious, and far below the character of man.&nbsp; They betook
themselves accordingly to some sound principles of moral truth
and moral <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>wisdom.&nbsp; Thus the faculty of right discrimination,
and the power of conscience, when not drowned in vice and
superstition, exhibited some lines, and showed some traces of the
great Creator&rsquo;s image.&nbsp; They reduced the rule of life
and of well-doing to some fixed points; prudence, justice,
fortitude, the love of truth, the scorn of falsehood or deceit,
self-government, with other noble qualities, exhibited plain
characters of man&rsquo;s first resemblance to the Author of his
being.&nbsp; Thus things which are always true and always good,
kept their place in some fair examples, and sustained the claim
which such men had to be the teachers and the monitors of others,
although without authority to teach or to direct&mdash;that want
remained to be supplied, as the wisest of them fairly owned.</p>
<p>Our blessed Lord, who came to bind the bruised reed, and to
fan the least spark of the smoking flax, never turned with scorn
from such tokens of good disposition and right judgment, or
failed to give his word of commendation when they came before
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not found so great faith, no not in
Israel,&rdquo; were words which embraced the qualities of mind
which were always found to be most favourable to prepare the
heart (the seat of every moral property) for any seed of truth
which should be cast upon it.&nbsp; Such was the good ground of
which our Lord made mention in his instructive parable of the
Sower and the Seed.&nbsp; A rational acknowledgment, with a just
esteem for what is good, is the soul of faith, of which <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the tenth
leper left a memorable proof.&nbsp; Without such moral properties
faith might be the hand for receiving any benefit, but where
would be the mind to understand its value, and perceive the
nature of its obligations?&nbsp; Let the nine lepers who were
healed, but returned not to give thanks, supply the answer.&nbsp;
But if the Gentile sages showed indeed sound judgment in reducing
rules of ethics to fixed principles, our blessed Lord with the
full warrant of divine authority formed the draft of faith and
duty, sometimes compendiously, and sometimes with particular
enumerations.</p>
<p>But again, with these main principles and never-changing
objects of regard, there is another word which has its special
season&mdash;it is that of pastoral entreaty; and it remains for
me to press it at this time&mdash;it results, indeed, from the
whole view which has been taken.</p>
<p>Never then, I beseech you, my beloved brethren, consent to
yield the profession or the practice of the rule of faith and
duty, for fear or favour; for any flattering bait or treacherous
inducement, never lose sight of what is due to God, to your
fellow-creatures, and yourselves;&mdash;only remember that if we
neglect to take thought for others, that is not the care for
ourselves which we are enjoined to extend to others.&nbsp; And
here I cannot sufficiently commend the manifold attentions of the
prudent and sincere, which have been paid to the needs of many in
this vicinage.&nbsp; O! let that care continue for your poorer
brethren&mdash;<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>let it manifest itself in the religious instructions
which your schools provide for their children, and in a thousand
instances of kindness which the succours which the law requires
cannot supply.</p>
<p>And yet again, amidst all these incumbent obligations, there
is still room for the words of Solomon, &ldquo;to every thing
there is a season;&rdquo; and the present moment constrains me
yet once more to conjure you to bear these things in mind, to
keep them as the treasure of your hearts.&nbsp; If such shall be
the purpose and endeavour, it matters less at what period the
foot is stayed, provided it be found in the right path when the
day of travel or of any special charge shall close.&nbsp; But in
such case, when we can no longer walk together as companions,
there must be the word of exhortation for those who have to go
forward&mdash;let it then be the word of the apostle&mdash;to
&ldquo;walk worthy of your vocation wherewith ye are called, with
all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one
another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in
the bond of peace.&nbsp; There is . . . one Spirit, even as ye
are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one
baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through
all, and in you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To us who have walked long together, there is another cheering
word on separation, when most happily the new guide, with every
hopeful commendation, is at hand and ready to succeed.</p>
<p>There is but one word more, one which cannot be <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>amplified,
for it contains the sum of every good wish, every grateful sense
and recollection of past kindnesses&mdash;there remains but the
little, yet significant and comprehensive word&mdash;farewell;
&ldquo;and this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and
more, in knowledge and in all judgment; that ye may approve
things that are excellent, that ye may be sincere, and without
offence until the day of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
